Imagine you are fluttering by in a peaceful meadow, and in the distance, you hear a loud, ungraceful, violent, troglodyte flapping by. Smashing their wings or all the good things within their reach. This is Flap.

Flap was born out of the thesaurus entry for the word Flutter, and as such, the obvious connection to that UI framework reveals that this is in fact a cheap knockoff of Flutter. Welcome to FLAP. Flap is a craftOS UI framework.

## Included functionality

Flap includes lua! But benefits include:

- An eventLoop abstraction over the `os.queueEvent`, that allows for queueing of callbacks and timers.
- *Some* builtin widgets, and a tree based recursive renderer.
- *Some* functionality...
